1.Given a string S, find the longest palindromic substring in S.
Input: "babad"

Output: "bab"

Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

2.Given a string, recursively remove adjacent duplicate characters from string. The output string should not have any adjacent duplicates. See following examples.
Input:  azxxzy

Output: ay

First "azxxzy" is reduced to "azzy". The string "azzy" contains duplicates, so it is further reduced to "ay". 

Input: caaabbbaacdddd

Output: Empty String 

Input: acaaabbbacdddd

Output: acac

3.Given two strings, the task is to find if a string ('a') can be obtained by rotating another string ('b') by two places.
Examples:
Input : a = "amazon"         b = "azonam"  // rotated anti-clockwise

Output : True 

Input : a = "amazon"        b = "onamaz"  // rotated clockwise

Output : True

4.Given an string in roman no format (s)  your task is to convert it to integer .
Example:
Input
2
V
III 
Output
5
3 

5.Given two strings ‘X’ and ‘Y’, find the length of the longest common substring.

Input : X = "abcdxyz", y = "xyzabcd"

Output : 4

The longest common substring is "abcd" and is oflength 4. 

Input : X = "zxabcdezy", y = "yzabcdezx"

Output : 6

The longest common substring is "abcdez" and is oflength 6.

6.Given a string, find length of the longest substring with all distinct characters.  For example, for input "abca", the output is 3 as "abc" is the longest substring with all distinct characters.

7.Your task  is to implement the function atoi. The function takes a string(str) as argument and converts it to an integer and returns it.

8.Your task  is to implement the function strstr. The function takes two strings as arguments(s,x) and  locates the occurrence of the string x in the string s. The function returns and integer denoting  the first occurrence of the string x .

9.Given a array of Nstrings, find the longest common prefix among all strings present in the array.
Input: apple ape April

Output: ap

10.Design a URL shortner like bit.ly
